Introduction
============

PgBackMan is a tool for managing PostgreSQL logical backups created
with ``pg_dump`` and ``pg_dumpall``.

It is designed to manage backups from thousands of databases running
in multiple PostgreSQL nodes, and it supports a multiple backup
servers topology.

It also manages role and database configuration information when
creating a backup of a database. This information is necessary to
ensure a 100% restore of a logical backup of a database and the
elements associated to it.

Even though a backup created with ``pg_dump`` or ``pg_dumpall`` can
never guarantee a full disaster recovery of all data changed between
the moment when the backup was taken and the moment of a future crash,
they are still necessary if you need to archive versions of a
database, move databases between PgSQL nodes and clone databases
between production, pre-production and/or development servers.

They are also an easy way of taken backups of databases not requiring
PITR backups.
	
PgBackMan is not a tool for managing PITR (Point in time recovery)
backups. There are several other solutions out there that can be use
for PITR backups, such as PITRTools, OmniPITR, and Barman. 

The PgBackMan code is distributed under the GNU General Public License
3 and it is totally written in Python and PL/PgSQL. It has been
developed and tested by members of the Database Operations Group at
the Center for Information Technology at the University of Oslo.

An example of how a system using PgBackMan may look like can be seen
in the next figure:

Main features
=============

The main features of PgBackMan are:

* Central database with metadata information.
* PgBackMan shell for interaction with the system.
* Management of multiple backup servers
* Management of multiple PostgreSQL servers
* Management of thousands of backups dumps through a catalogue
* Manual and scheduled backups 
* Management of retention policies for backups dumps.
* Fully detailed backup reports.
* Multiple predefined database backup types, CLUSTER, FULL, SCHEMA, DATA.
* Full backup of role information for a database.
* Full backup of database configuration for a database.
* Automatic definitions of backups for all databases running in a PgSQL node.
* Automatic restore procedures
* Autonomous pgbackman_dump program that functions even if the central database with metadata is not available.
* Handling of error situations.
* Totally written in Python and PL/PgSQL 
* Distributed under the GNU General Public License 3

Future features will include:

* Moving of backup definitions between backup servers.
* Automatic cloning of databases between PgSQL nodes.
* Disk space reports 


Architecture and components
===========================

The components forming part of PgBackMan could be listed as follows:

* **Backup servers:** One or several backup servers running
  PgBackMan. All SQL dumps and logfiles are saved in these
  servers. They need access via ``libpq`` to the postgreSQL nodes
  where the backup server will be allow to run backups and restores.

* **PGnodes**: PostgreSQL servers running postgreSQL databases.

* **PgBackMan DB**: Central postgreSQL metadata database used by PgBackMan. All
  backup servers need access to this database.

* **PgBackMan shell:** This is a program that must be run in a text
  terminal. It can be run in any of the backup servers registered in
  the system. It is the console used to manage PgBackMan.

* **pgbackman_control:** This program runs in every backup server and
  takes care of updating crontab files and creating AT jobs when
  backup, snapshots or restore definitions are created, when PgSQL
  nodes are stopped or deleted, or when backup definitions are stopped
  or deleted.

* **pgbackman_maintenence:** This programs runs in every backup server
  and runs some maintenance jobs needed by PgBackMan. It enforces
  retentions for backup and snapshot definitions. It deletes backup
  and log files from catalog entries associated to a backup definition
  after this definition has been deleted with the force parameter. And
  it process all pending backup/restore catalog log files in the
  server created if the pgbackman database has been down when
  ``pgbackman_dump`` and ``pgbackman_restore`` have been running.

* **pgbackman_dump:** This program runs in the backup servers when a backup
  or snapshot has to be taken.

* **pgbackman_restore:** This program runs in the backup servers when
  a restore has to be run.

The next figure shows all the components forming part of PgBackMan and
how they interact with each other:

Installation
============

You will have to install the PgBackMan software in all the servers
that are going to be used as backup servers by PgBackMan.

System requirements
-------------------

* Linux/Unix
* Python 2.6 or 2.7
* Python modules:
  - psycopg2
  - argparse
    
* PostgreSQL >= 9.0 for the ``pgbackman`` database
* PostgreSQL >= 9.0 in all PgSQL nodes that are going to use PgBackMan
  to manage logical backups.
* AT and CRON installed and running.

Before you install PgBackMan you have to install the software needed
by this tool

In systems using ``yum``::

  yum install python-psycopg2 python-argparse at

In system using ``apt-get``::

  apt-get install python-psycopg2 python-argparse at

If you are going to install from source, you need to install also
these packages: ``python-devel, python-setuptools, git, make, rst2pdf``

In systems using ``yum``::

  yum install python-devel python-setuptools git make rst2pdf

In system using ``apt-get``::

  apt-get install python-devel python-setuptools git make rst2pdf


Installing from source
----------------------

The easiest way to install PgBackMan from source is to get the last
version from the master branch at the GitHub repository.

::

 [root@server]# cd
 [root@server]# git clone https://github.com/rafaelma/pgbackman.git

 [root@server]# cd pgbackman
 [root@server]# ./setup.py install
 .....

This will install all users, groups, programs, configuration files, logfiles and the
pgbackman module in your system.

If you want to generate the PgBackMan manual with the documentation,
you can do this::

 [root@server]# cd pgbackman/docs
 [root@server]# make clean
 [root@server]# make

Installing via RPM packages
---------------------------

RPM packages are available ...

Installing Via Deb packages
----------------------------

Deb packages are available ...


Installing the pgbackman Database
---------------------------------

After the requirements and the PgBackMan software are installed, you
have to install the ``pgbackman`` database in a server running
PostgreSQL. This database is the core of the PgBackMan tool and it is
used to save all the metadata needed to manage the system.

You can get this database from the directory ``sql/`` in the source
code or under the directory ``/usr/share/pgbackman`` if you have
installed PgBackMan via ``rpm`` or ``deb`` packages.


Configuration
=============

Backup servers
--------------

A backup server needs to have access to the ``pgbackman`` database and
to all PgSQL nodes where is taken backups or restoring data. This can
be done like this:

#. Update ``/etc/pgbackman/pgbackman.conf`` with the database
   parameters needed by PgBackMan to access the central metadata
   database. You need to define ``host`` or ``hostaddr``, ``port``,
   ``dbname``, ``database`` under the section
   ``[pgbackman_database]``.

   You can also define ``password`` in this section but we discourage
   to do this and recommend to define a ``.pgpass`` file in the home
   directory of the users ``root`` and ``pgbackman`` with this
   information, e.g.::

     dbhost.domain:5432:pgbackman:pgbackman_role_rw:PASSWORD

   and set the privileges of this file with ``chmod 400 ~/.pgpass``.

   Even a better solution will be to use the ``cert`` autentication for
   the pgbackman database user so we do not need to save passwords
   around.

#. Update and reload the ``pg_hba.conf`` file in the postgreSQL server
   running the pgbackman database, with a line that gives access to
   the pgbackman database from the new backup server. We recommend to
   use a SSL connection to encrypt all the trafikk between the database
   server and the backup server, e.g.::

     hostssl   pgbackman   pgbackman_role_rw    10.20.20.20.200/32     md5 

#. Define the backup server in PgBackMan via the PgBackMan shell::

     [pgbackman@pg-backup01 ~]# pgbackman

     +-------+------------------+----------------------+

#. Create the root directory / partition in the backup derver that
   will be used to save all backups, logfiles, and syem data needed by
   PgBackMan in



PgSQL nodes
-----------

Every PgSQL node defined in PgBackMan will need to update and reload
his ``pg_hba.conf`` file also to give access to the admin user
(``postgres`` per default) from the backup serveres defined in
PgBackMan, e.g.::

    hostssl   *   postgres    10.20.20.20.200/32     md5 

Remember that the ``.pgpass`` file of the ``pgbackman`` user in the
backup server has to be updated with the information needed to access
every PgSQL node we are goint to take backups for.



System administration and maintenance
=====================================

PgBackMan has two components which are used to administrate and
maintain the backups, snapshots, restores and information associated
to PgSQL nodes registered in the system.

They are started with the script ``/etc/init.d/pgbackman`` and must
run in every Backup server running PgBackMan.

pgbackman_crontrol
------------------

This program runs in a loop waiting for NOTIFY messages from the
``pgbackman`` database before executing an action. It will get a
notification when:

* A new PgSQL node has been defined in the system.
* A PgSQL node is deleted from the system.
* A PgSQL node changes its status from RUNNING to STOPPED or vice
  versa.
* A snapshot backup has been defined.
* A backup restore has been defined.
* A new backup definition has been defined.
* A backup definition has been deleted.
* A backup definition has been updated.

The actions this program can execute are:

* Create the directory used for cached information from backup servers
  and PgSQL nodes.
* Delete the associated cache information when a PgSQL node gets
  deleted.
* Create a directory for pending log information.
* Create directories for backups and logs per PgSQL node defined in
  the system.
* Delete directories for backups and logs when a PgSQL node gets deleted.
* Update crontab files when new backup definitions get defined or
  deleted.
* Update crontab files when nodes get updated.
* Delete crontab files when nodes get deleted.
* Create an ``at`` job when a snapshot backup gets defined.
* Create an ``at`` job when a backup restore gets defined.

Every PgSQL node in the system will have its own directories and
crontab file in every backup server running PgBackMan.


pgbackman_maintenance
---------------------

This program can be executed in a cron modus (one single interaction per
execution) or in a loop (default).

It runs these maintenance tasks:

* Enforce retention policies for backup definitions. It deletes backup
  files, log files and catalog information for backups that have
  expired.

* Enforce retention policies for snapshots. It deletes backup
  files, log files and catalog information for snapshots that have
  expired.

* Delete backup and log files from catalog entries associated to a
  backup definition after this definition has been deleted with the
  ``force-deletion`` parameter.

* Delete restore logs files when definitions/catalogs used by the
  restore are deleted.

* Process pending backup catalog log files in the backup server. These
  files are created when the ``pgbackman`` database is not available
  for updating the catalog information metadata after a backup.

* Process pending restore catalog log files in the backup
  server. These files are created when the ``pgbackman`` database is
  not available for updating the catalog information metadata after a
  restore.

This command deletes a backup server defined in PgBackMan::

  Command: delete_backup_server [SrvID | FQDN]

Parameters:

* **[SrvID | FQDN]:** SrvID in PgBackMan or FQDN of the backup server
  to delete.

You can use the backup server ID in PgBackMan or the FQDN of the
server to choose the server to be deleted.

One have to delete all backup definitions associated to a backup
server or move them to another backup server before one can delete a
backup server from the system.

You will get an error if you try to delete a backup server that has
active backup definitions associated. This is a safety measure to avoid
operational errors with catastrophic consequences. This type of
deletion cannot be forced.

This command can be run with or without parameters. e.g.::

  [pgbackman]$ delete_backup_server 2

  [Done] Backup server deleted.

register_pgsql_node
-------------------

This command registers a PgSQL node in PgBackMan.::

  register_pgsql_node [hostname] [domain] [pgport] [admin_user] [status] [remarks]

Parameters:

* **[hostname]:** Hostname of the PgSQL node
* **[domain]:** Domain name of the PgSQL node
* **[pgport]:** PostgreSQL port
* **[admin_user]:** PostgreSQL admin user
* **[status]:**
  
  * RUNNING: PostgreSQL node running and online
  * DOWN: PostgreSQL node not online.

* **[remarks]:** Remarks

All backup definitions from a PgSQL node will be started/stopped
automatisk if the PgSQL node gets the status changed to RUNNING/DOWN.

The default value for a parameter is shown between brackets ``[]``. If
the user does not define any value, the default value will be
used. This command can be run with or without parameters. e.g:

::

   [pgbackman]$ register_pgsql_node pg-node01 "" "" "" running "Test node"

   [Done] PgSQL node pg-node01.example.net registered.

::

   [pgbackman]$ register_pgsql_node
   --------------------------------------------------------
   # Hostname []: pg-node01
   # Domain [example.org]: 
   # Port [5432]: 
   # Admin user [postgres]: 
   # Status[STOPPED]: running
   # Remarks []: Test node
   
   # Are all values correct (yes/no): yes
   --------------------------------------------------------

   [Done] PgSQL node pg-node01.example.org registered.


register_restore_definition
---------------------------

This command defines a restore job of a backup from the catalog. It
can be run only interactively.

Parameters:

* **[AT time]:** Timestamp to run the restore job.
* **[BckID]:** ID of the backup to restore.
* **[Target NodeID | FQDN]:** PgSQL node ID or FQDN where we want to
  restore the backup.

  pg_restore

This command can be run only without parameters. e.g:

::

   [pgbackman]$ register_restore_definition
   --------------------------------------------------------
   # AT timestamp [2014-05-30 09:44:04.503880]: 
   # BckID []: 35
   # Target NodeID / FQDN []: 2
   # Target DBname [pgbackman]: 
   # Extra parameters []: 
   
   # Are all values correct (yes/no): yes
   --------------------------------------------------------
   [Processing restore data]
   --------------------------------------------------------
   [OK]: Target DBname pgbackman does not exist on target PgSQL node.
   
   [OK]: Role 'pgbackman_role_rw' does not exist on target PgSQL node.
   
   [WARNING]: Role 'postgres' already exists on target PgSQL node.
   # Use the existing role? (yes/no): yes
   
   --------------------------------------------------------
   [Restore definition accepted]
   --------------------------------------------------------
   AT time: 2014-05-30 09:44:04.503880
   BckID to restore: 35
   Roles to restore: pgbackman_role_rw
   Backup server: [1] pg-backup01.example.net
   Target PgSQL node: [2] pg-node01.example.net
   Target DBname: pgbackman
   Extra restore parameters: 
   Existing database will be renamed to : None
   --------------------------------------------------------
   # Are all values correct (yes/no): yes
   --------------------------------------------------------

   [Done] Restore definition registered.

There are some issues we have to take care of when running a restore
of a backup. What happens if we want to restore a backup of a database
or a role that already exists in the target server?

This flowchar figure explains the logic used when restoring a backup
if our restore definition create some conflicts:

update_backup_server
--------------------

This command updates some parameters of a backup server defined in
PgbackMan::

  Command: update_backup_server [SrvID | FQDN] [remarks]

It can be run with or without parameters. e.g.::

  update_backup_server 1 "Main backup server"

  [pgbackman]$ update_backup_server
  --------------------------------------------------------
  # SrvID / FQDN []: 1
  # Remarks []: Main backup server

  # Are all values to update correct (yes/no): yes
  --------------------------------------------------------

You can use the backup server ID in PgBackMan or the FQDN to choose
the server to be updated.





About backups in PostgreSQL
===========================

Taking backups is a very important administrative task that can have
some disastrous consequences if it is not done right. The use of RAID
configurations in your storage system, replication between nodes,
clustering and trusting 100% that your SAN will be up ARE NOT backup
strategies. They do not replace the necessity of taking backups of our
databases..

There are two different types of backup that can be use with
PostgreSQL to implement a good backup and restore strategy. They are:

* Physical backups 
* Logical backups

Regardless of the type of backup used to backup your databases, one
needs a god *backup and restore plan* that takes into account
interval, retention and performance issues during a backup and the
time needed to get a full restore of a database.

Physical backups
----------------
	  
This type of backup .... 

	  
Logical backups
---------------

PostgreSQL has two utilities, ``pg_dump`` and ``pg_dumpall``, for
taking logical backups of databases. They take a snapshot of a
database at a given moment.

These utilities take consistent backups of a database or the hole
cluster even if the databases are being used concurrently. At the same
time ``pg_dump`` and ``pg_dumpall`` do not block other users accessing
the database when backups are been taking.

Even though a backup or snapshot created with ``pg_dump`` or
``pg_dumpall`` can never guarantee a full disaster recovery of all
data changed between the moment when the backup was taken and the
moment of a future crash, they are still necessary if you need to
archive versions of a database, move databases between PgSQL nodes and
clone databases between production / pre-production and/or development
servers.

Anyway, they give us a great flexibility and are also an easy way of
taken backups of databases not requiring PITR backups.

When taking a backup of a database we need the following information
to be sure we can make a restore that includes 100% of the data and
definitions from the target database:

* Database schema
* Database data
* Roles owning objects in the database
* Roles with privileges on objects in the database
* Roles with privileges on the database or schemas
* Creation of all the roles owning something or with privileges
* Configuration parameters defined explicitly for a role
* Configuration parameters defined explicitly for the database 

Unfortunately all this information cannot be obtained in a single
execution for only one database. 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be obtained with
``pg_dump``. 5, 7 and 8 can be obtained with a full ``pg_dumpall`` and
6 either with a ``pg_dumpall -r`` or a full ``pg_dumpall``.

At the same time, ``pg_dumpall`` will return all this information for
all databases in a cluster, not only the database one wants to take a
backup of.

This is something that PostgreSQL will have to improve in the future
so it gets easier to take a backup/snapshot of a database in a single
execution.

In the meantime, PgBackMan takes care of all this and it delivers all
the information needed to run a 100% restore of a database when we
define a backup in the system.

Submitting a bug
================

PgBakMan has been extensively tested, and is currently being used in
production at the University of Oslo. However, as any software,
PgBackMan is not bug free.

If you discover a bug, please file a bug through the GitHub Issue page
for the project at: https://github.com/rafaelma/pgbackman/issues
